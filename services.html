                        <p class="mb-5">The blade of a cricket bat is a wooden block that is generally flat on the striking face and with a ridge on the reverse (back) which concentrates wood in the middle where the ball is generally hit. The bat is traditionally made from willow wood, specifically from a variety of white willow called cricket bat willow (Salix alba var. caerulea), treated with raw (unboiled) linseed oil, which has a protective function. This variety of willow is used as it is very tough and shock-resistant, not being significantly dented nor splintering on the impact of a cricket ball at high speed, while also being light in weight.</p>

                            <p class="tm-strategy-text">English willow is the only willow chosen by the influx of foreign cricketers. It’s been mass-produced because every professional batsman desires to use the English willow bat. The English willow bat is popular as it is the only willow that gives the cricket bat contraction and toughness. English willow is a type of willow that is native to England. It is also acknowledged as a white willow. There are primarily five grades (1–5) of English Willow bats, the higher grade one being the best quality and having straighter grains on the bat. But they are a bit more expensive than regular bats.</p>

                            <p class="tm-strategy-text">As the name suggests, Kashmiri willow is made from Kashmiri wood. Kashmir willow is a highly sought-after wood in India, which is used to make cricket bats. Kashmir willow bats vary from English willow bats in appearance as well as reliability. Because Kashmir willow bats are brownish, we can easily distinguish them from English willow. The Kashmir willow bat is made by hand, which is why the cost of the bat is a little higher. The Kashmir willow bat is extremely light in weight. Kashmir willow bat popularity is propelling the market growth because every newbie chooses to play with the Kashmir willow bat.</p>

                    <p class="mb-5">Law 5 of the Laws of Cricket state that the length of the bat may be no more than 38 in (965 mm), the width no more than 4.25 in (108 mm), the overall depth no more than 2.64 in (67 mm) and edge no more than 1.56 in (40 mm). Appendix B of the Laws of Cricket set out more precise specifications.[7] This rule was introduced following the Monster Bat Incident of 1771.</p>
                    <p class="mb-5">The 2017 update to the Laws saw no changes to the maximum length of the bat, which is still 38 inches/96.52 cm, but a new specification stated that the edge of the bat cannot be more than 1.56 inches / 4 cm while the depth cannot be more than 2.64 inches / 6.7 cm.[8] The umpires are now given a bat gauge so they can check the legality of the bat at any time.</p>
                    <p>Bats are available in a range of sizes, with some manufacturers offering unique variations. Commonly found are children's sizes 0 to 6, youth size Harrow and adult sizes. SH (Short Handle) is the most common adult size, whilst long handle and long blade options are also available. Children's sizes increase in length and width as the size increase. Although most adult bats will be the maximum width permitted (4.25 inches), no generally available cricket bat is the maximum length of 38 inches, indeed very few exceed 35 inches.</p>

                        <p class="mb-0 text-white">A cricket bat is a specialised piece of equipment used by batters in the sport of cricket to hit the ball, typically consisting of a cane handle attached to a flat-fronted willow-wood blade. It may also be used by a batter who is making ground to avoid a run out, by holding the bat and touching the ground with it. The length of the bat may be no more than 38 inches (96.5 cm) and the width no more than 4.25 inches (10.8 cm). Its use is first mentioned in 1624. Since 1979, a law change has provided that cricket bats can only be made from wood.</p>

                    <p>When first purchased, most bats are not ready for immediate use and require knocking-in to allow the soft fibres to strike a hard new cricket ball without causing damage to the bat, and allowing full power to be transferred to the shot.</p>
                </div>

                    <p> Knocking-in involves striking the surface with an old cricket ball or a special mallet. This compacts the soft fibres within the bat and reduces the risk of the bat snapping. The bat may also need raw linseed oil, which fills in the gaps between the fibres.</p>
                </div>

                    <p>Raw linseed oil is used, rather than boiled linseed oil, as the raw form is also a drying oil but very slow "drying", and so the surface remains tacky. Applied regularly, this has a protective effect on the wood and makes it less sensitive to humidity changes in the atmosphere, which could cause warping or splitting.</p>

                    <p>Another important factor is that it increases the surface friction of the ball to bat surface, giving better control of the shot. A worn surface can be noticed by the player, indicating that re-oiling is needed.</p>
